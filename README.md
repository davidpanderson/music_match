# music_match
A Web-based system for matching classical music composers and performers

A web site that lets composers and performers
* Create accounts
* Create "profiles" describing their musical interests and abilities
* Search for and communicate with other musicians.

It's implemented in PHP, and uses a bunch of code from BOINC
for basic stuff like keeping track of accounts in a MySQL DB.
