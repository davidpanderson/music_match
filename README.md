# Music Match
A Web-based system for establishing communication
between classical musicians (composers, performers, teachers, technicians).

Its [web site](https://music-match.org) lets musicians
* Create accounts
* Create "profiles" describing their musical interests and abilities
* Search for and communicate with other musicians.

Music Match is implemented in PHP, and uses a bunch of code from BOINC
for basic stuff like keeping track of accounts in a MySQL DB.
