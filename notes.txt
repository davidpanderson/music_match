The original idea is to hook up composers and performers.
But if we're going to bring together classical musicians,
we may as well think of ALL the ways they might want to interact,
and support as many ways as we easily can.

Use cases
    performer wants to find pieces to play
        create account
        do composer search
            only composers with scores online?
        get scores, or communicate with composer to request
            piece, request changes, etc.
        Notify performer if new composers arrive
    performer wants to find composers, commission a piece
    performer wants to ask composer about a particular piece
    performer wants to find (local) performers
        singer seeks accompanist or vice versa
        group (e.g. string quartet) seeks new member
        member seeks group
    composer wants to find performer to play piece
        create account
        do performer search
    composer wants to find performer to perform piece at a Groupmuse
        possibly local
        find vetted performer, send them message
    composer wants help with editing software (score editing/rendering etc.)
        create account
        browse message boards
    performer wants help with recording technology
        message board
    composer wants guidance or feedback on a composition, or in general
    performer/composer agree that a piece will be used in a groupmuse
        arrange for payment to composer

questions:
    composers: what editing software do you use?
        Musescore, Sibelius, Finale
    flag for composers saying whether they have scores online?
    require
        creating an account before doing search?
        creating a profile before doing search?
    flag for performer: vetted by Groupmuse
    provide a chat system?

performer groups
    string quartet, wind ensemble, choir, piano/violin duo etc.
    performers can be linked to a group,
        but the group has its own profile (styles, links etc.)
    composers can search for groups
    Implementation: each group is a user,
    with its own email addr and password.
    Linking a performer to a group:
        log in as group
        send invitation to performer
        performer accepts

concept: make pieces and recordings explicit
    In this model, MM knows about individual pieces and recordings of them.
    composers list compositions and provide scores
    performers can upload performances of them
    link the two together:
        a composer page shows list of pieces,
        and for each piece a list of recordings,
        with links to performer pages
    This is analogous to IMSLP, but we can do this better than IMSLP
    We could also let performers provide score markings (fingering, phrasing)
        as separate layers

talk with Mosa
- I'll develop it on my own
- I'd like review/comments from you, Kyle, Dara etc. if possible
    - choice of name
    - list of style names, instruments, etc.
    - UI, features
- When it's done, need to get critical mass of both performers and composers
    can you announce to GM performers?
    referrals to composers groups would be great (I've learned of a couple)
- Eventually would be good to integrate into GM somehow.
    Would be good for me to have a chat with Kyle to discuss
    how to make this possible/easier

I searcher is outside the US
    show only results from same country
else
    if searcher's zip code not recognized
        say that
        show results IN US
    else
        show only results with zip, and distance < 100 miles
